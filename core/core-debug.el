  "Check parenthesis bugs or similar horrors.
  Even with Emacs advanced programming facilities, checking mismatching
  parenthesis or missing quote (so called \"pbug\") is no less annoying than
  pointer chasing in C.

  This function divides the buffer into regions and tries evaluating them one
  by one.  It stops at the first region where it fails to evaluate because of
  pbug or any other errors.  It sets point and mark (and highlights if
  variable `transient-mark-mode' is on) on the failing region and center its first
  line.  \"^def\" is used to define regions.  You may also `eval-region'
  right after pbug is done to let Lisp parse pinpoint the bug.

  No more \"End of file during parsing\" horrors!"
