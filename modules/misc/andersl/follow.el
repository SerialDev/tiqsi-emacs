;;{{{ Documentation

;; `Follow mode' is a minor mode for Emacs and XEmacs that
;; combines windows into one tall virtual window.
;;
;; The feeling of a "virtual window" has been accomplished by the use
;; of two major techniques:
;;
;; * The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
;;   This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
;;   others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow Mode.)
;;
;; * Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
;;   window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
;;   makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
;;   movement commands.
;;
;; Follow mode comes to its prime when a large screen and two
;; side-by-side window are used. The user can, with the help of Follow
;; mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
;; one. Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
;; and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
;; mileage may vary).


;; The latest version, and a demonstration, are avaiable at:
;;
;;	http://www.csd.uu.se/~andersl/emacs.shtml


;; To test this package, make sure `follow' is loaded, or will be
;; autoloaded when activated (see below). Then do the following:
;;
;; * Find your favorite file (preferably a long one).
;;
;; * Resize Emacs so that it will be wide enough for two full size
;;   columns.  Delete the other windows and split the window with
;;   the commands `C-x 1 C-x 3'.
;;
;; * Give the command:
;;	M-x follow-mode <RETURN>
;;
;; * Now the display should look something like (assuming the text "71"
;;   is on line 71):
;;
;;		    +----------+----------+
;;		    |1         |73        |
;;		    |2         |74        |
;;		    |3         |75        |
;;		         ...        ...
;;		    |71        |143       |
;;		    |72        |144       |
;;		    +----------+----------+
;;
;;   As you can see, the right-hand window starts at line 73, the line
;;   immediately below the end of the left-hand window. As long as
;;   `follow-mode' is active, the two windows will follow eachother!
;;
;; * Play around and enjoy! Scroll one window and watch the other.
;;   Jump to the beginning or end. Press `Cursor down' at the last
;;   line of the left-hand window. Enter new lines into the
;;   text. Enter long lines spanning several lines, or several
;;   windows.
;;
;; * Should you find `Follow' mode annoying, just type
;;	M-x follow-mode <RETURN>
;;   to turn it off.


;; The command `follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' maximises the
;; visible area of the current buffer.
;;
;; I recommend adding it, and `follow-mode', to hotkeys in the global
;; key map.  To do so, add the following lines (replacing `[f7]' and
;; `[f8]' with your favorite keys) to the init file:
;;
;; (global-set-key [f8] 'follow-mode)
;; (global-set-key [f7] 'follow-delete-other-windows-and-split)


;; There exists two system variables that controls the appearence of
;; lines that are wider than the window containing them.  The default
;; is to truncate long lines whenever a window isn't as wide as the
;; frame.
;;
;; To make sure lines are never truncated, please place the following
;; lines in your init file:
;;
;; (setq truncate-lines nil)
;; (setq truncate-partial-width-windows nil)


;; Since the display of XEmacs is pixel-oriented, a line could be
;; clipped in half at the bottom of the window.
;;
;; To make XEmacs avoid clipping (normal) lines, please place the
;; following line in your init-file:
;;
;; (setq pixel-vertical-clip-threshold 30)


;; The correct way to cofigurate Follow mode, or any other mode for
;; that matter, is to create one (or more) function that does
;; whatever you would like to do.  The function is then added to
;; a hook.
;;
;; When `Follow' mode is activated, functions stored in the hook
;; `follow-mode-hook' are called.  When it is deactivated
;; `follow-mode-off-hook' is runed.
;;
;; The keymap `follow-key-map' contains key bindings activated by
;; `follow-mode'.
;;
;; Example:
;; (add-hook 'follow-mode-hook 'my-follow-mode-hook)
;;
;; (defun my-follow-mode-hook ()
;;    (define-key follow-mode-map "\C-ca" 'your-favorite-function)
;;    (define-key follow-mode-map "\C-cb" 'another-function))


;; Usage:
;;
;; To activate issue the command "M-x follow-mode"
;; and press return. To deactivate, do it again.
;;
;; The following is a list of commands useful when follow-mode is active.
;;
;;	follow-scroll-up			 C-c . C-v
;;		Scroll text in a Follow Mode window chain up.
;;
;;	follow-scroll-down			 C-c . v
;;		Like `follow-scroll-up', but in the other direction.
;;
;;	follow-delete-other-windows-and-split	 C-c . 1
;;		Maximise the visible area of the current buffer,
;;		and enter Follow Mode. 	This is a very convenient
;;		way to start Follow Mode, hence it is recomended
;;		that this command is added to the global keymap.
;;
;;	follow-recenter				 C-c . C-l
;;		Place the point in the center of the middle window,
;;		or a specified number of lines from either top or bottom.
;;
;;	follow-switch-to-buffer			 C-c . b
;;		Switch buffer in all windows displaying the current buffer
;;		in this frame.
;;
;;	follow-switch-to-buffer-all		 C-c . C-b
;;		Switch buffer in all windows in the active frame.
;;
;;	follow-switch-to-current-buffer-all
;;		Show the current buffer in all windows on the current
;;		frame and turn on `follow-mode'.
;;
;;	follow-first-window			 C-c . <
;;		Select the first window in the frame showing the same buffer.
;;
;;	follow-last-window			 C-c . >
;;		Select the last window in the frame showing the same buffer.
;;
;;	follow-next-window			 C-c . n
;;		Select the next window in the frame showing the same buffer.
;;
;;	follow-previous-window			 C-c . p
;;		Select the previous window showing the same buffer.


;; Well, it seems ok, but what if I really want to look at two different
;; positions in the text? Here are two simple methods to use:
;;
;; 1) Use multiple frames; `follow' mode only affects windows displayed
;;    in the same frame. (My apoligies to you who can't use frames.)
;;
;; 2) Bind `follow-mode' to key so you can turn it off whenever
;;    you want to view two locations. Of course, `follow' mode can
;;    be reactivated by hitting the same key again.
;;
;;    Example from my ~/.emacs:
;;	(global-set-key [f8] 'follow-mode)


;; Implementation:
;;
;; In an ideal world, follow mode would have been implemented in the
;; kernel of the display routines, making sure that the windows (using
;; follow mode) ALWAYS are aligned. On planet earth, however, we must
;; accept a solution where we ALMOST ALWAYS can make sure that the
;; windows are aligned.
;;
;; Follow mode does this in three places:
;; 1) After each user command.
;; 2) After a process output has been perfomed.
;; 3) When a scrollbar has been moved.
;;
;; This will cover most situations. (Let me know if there are other
;; situations that should be covered.)
;;
;; Note that only the selected window is checked, for the reason of
;; efficiency and code complexity. (I.e. it is possible to make a
;; non-selected windows unaligned. It will, however, pop right back
;; when it is selected.)

;;; Code:

;;{{{ Preliminaries

;; Make the compiler shut up!
;; There are two strategies:
;; 1) Shut warnings off completely.
;; 2) Handle each warning separately.
;;
;; Since I would like to see real errors, I've selected the latter
;; method.
;;
;; The problem with undefined variables and functions has been solved
;; by using `set', `symbol-value' and `symbol-function' rather than
;; `setq' and direct references to variables and functions.
;;
;; For example:
;;	(if (boundp 'foo)   ... (symbol-value 'foo) )
;;	(set 'foo ...)   <-- XEmacs doesn't fall for this one.
;;	(funcall (symbol-function 'set) 'bar ...)
;;
;; Note: When this file is interpreted, `eval-when-compile' is
;; evaluted.  Since it doesn't hurt to evaluate it, but it is a bit
;; annoying, we test if the byte-compiler has been loaded.  This can,
;; of course, lead to some occasional unintended evaluation...
;;
;; Should someone come up with a better solution, please let me
;; know.

  "Minor mode that combines windows into one tall virtual window.

The feeling of a \"virtual window\" has been accomplished by the use
of two major techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow Mode.)

* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side window are used. The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one. Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\\[split-window-horizontally]' or \
`M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each-other.

If the variable `follow-intercept-processes' is non-nil, Follow mode
will listen to the output of processes and redisplay accordingly.
\(This is the default.)

When Follow mode is switched on, the hook `follow-mode-hook'
is called.  When turned off, `follow-mode-off-hook' is called.

;;;
;;; If the display is updated, all windows starting at (point-max) are
;;; going to be recentered at the next redisplay, unless we do a
;;; read-and-write cycle to update the `force' flag inside the windows.

;;; since when it is called for a tail window, it is to late.  However,
;;; if it is called for another window, we can try to update our
;;; windows.
;;;
;;; By patching `sit-for' we can make sure that to catch all explicit
;;; updates initiated by lisp programs.  Internal calls, on the other
;;; hand, are not handled.
;;;
;;; Please note that the function `follow-avoid-tail-recenter' is also
